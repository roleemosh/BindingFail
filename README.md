# BindingFail

The "FieldTag" control works in Debug mode, but in Release mode, it is not binded. However, if I change the value of the "x:Name" property in a FieldTag, it works correctly. Nevertheless, I think this behavior is not consistent, and it is not possible to set the same "x:Name" properties this way.
